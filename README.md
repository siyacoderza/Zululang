# Zululang 🐍🇿🇦

**Zululang** is a Zulu-inspired programming language designed to make learning to code more accessible, human, and culturally relevant for isiZulu speakers and beginners.

Zululang is not meant to replace existing languages like Python or JavaScript. Instead, it acts as a **bridge language** — helping learners understand programming concepts in familiar language, then smoothly transition to mainstream technologies.

## 🌍 Why Zululang?

Many people struggle to learn programming because:
- Keywords are in unfamiliar languages
- Error messages are intimidating
- Learning feels disconnected from their culture

Zululang addresses this by:
- Using **Zulu-style keywords**
- Keeping syntax simple and readable
- Providing a friendly learning experience

Programming should feel like thinking — not translating.

---

## ✨ Features

- Zulu-inspired keywords (`bonisa`, `uma`, `ngenkathi`, `umsebenzi`)
- Simple, Python-like syntax
- Custom file extension: `.zul`
- Beginner-friendly structure
- Runs by translating Zululang code into Python
